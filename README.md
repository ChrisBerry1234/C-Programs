# C Programming Projects

This folder contains standalone C programming projects that explore fundamental and advanced concepts in the C language. These are console-based or file-driven programs aimed at deepening my understanding of systems-level programming.

## ðŸ§  Key Learning Areas

- Pointers and memory manipulation
- Manual memory management (`malloc`, `calloc`, `free`)
- Custom data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues)
- File I/O and parsing
- Bitwise operations
- Command-line tools
- C Standard Library usage

## ðŸ”§ Compilation

Use GCC (or any C compiler):

```bash
gcc project_name.c -o project_name
./project_name
